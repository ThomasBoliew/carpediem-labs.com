							<h2>Carpe Diem Labs ....</h2>
							<p>Hello and welcome to Carpe Diem Labs.  A budding application company that is just getting started whose main goal is to make simple tasks that effect all of our lives more effortless.  In the coming months and years we hope to lessen exertion when it comes to certain tasks and let people put thought into what matters.  It seems a simple thing to write in these words but hopefully looking back we will see how we are just getting started...</p>
